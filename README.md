# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Define the coordinates of the two points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
### Step 2: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values of x1, y1, x2, and y2 into the formula.
### Step 4: 
 Calculate (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1).
### Step 5: 
Square the results from Step 4.
### Step 6:
Add the squared values from Step 5 and then take the square root to get the distance.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
